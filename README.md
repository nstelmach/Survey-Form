# Survey Form

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/nstelmach/pen/dyNQEZe](https://codepen.io/nstelmach/pen/dyNQEZe).

The goal of this project was to learn HTML and CSS. I focused on styling the form. I was supposed to use tags such as h1, p, form, input, label, button, select, option, textarea and, attributes such as min, max, type, placeholder, and value. Many tags were supposed to have an id. In the future, I plan to refactor styles into classes using BEM naming convention, use CSS Reset and increase availability by adding appropriate aria labels.
